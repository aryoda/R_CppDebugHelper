# See /etc/R/Makeconf
#
# When a package is installed using R CMD INSTALL, make is used to control compilation and linking
# into a shared object for loading into R.
# There are default make variables and rules for this
# (determined when R is configured and recorded in R_HOME/etcR_ARCH/Makeconf).
#
# There are platform-specific file names on Windows: src/Makevars.win takes precedence over src/Makevars
# and src/Makefile.win must be used.
#
# Do only set PKG_ variables, do not set variables such as CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS!
#
# Package-local Makevars

PKG_CXXFLAGS = -g3    # -O0 -Wall   is GCC specific an cannot be used on all platforms

# Flags that are already set can be overridden by the environment variable MAKEFLAGS
# MAKEFLAGS="CXXFLAGS = -g3 -O3"   # does not work

# TODO How to inject -g3 -O0 permanently to make this package a base for debugging tutorial?

# From other packages
# PKG_CPPFLAGS = -DARMA_NO_DEBUG
# CXX_STD = CXX11
# PKG_CXXFLAGS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
# PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS) $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)
